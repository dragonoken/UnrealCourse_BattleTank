# BattleTank Project

Part of the [Unreal Engine Developer](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse) Course on Udemy.

I'm just a student following along the course and trying to get it work and, hopefully, produce a fun game.

Not really trying to share, although I do not mind.

If you've come across this repository, well, thank you and you're welcome to look around or just ignore it.

Have a nice day, or good night, or whatever time it is for you...
